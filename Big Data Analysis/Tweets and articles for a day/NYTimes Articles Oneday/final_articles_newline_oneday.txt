advertisementopinionsupported bythe white southern anti trumpimagemayor mitch landrieu of new orleans speech he gave after the city pulled down four confederate statues led to talk of mr landrieu as potential presidential contender creditjacquelyn martin associated pressby michelle goldbergmarch last may mitch landrieu the mayor of new orleans delivered one of the most stirring and important speeches of the trump era without once deigning to mention the president name he spoke after new orleans pulled down four confederate monuments the culmination of ferocious two year political fight that included threats armed right wing protesters and car being firebombed all around the country there was bitter debate about what to do with monuments to slavery and treason most erected by white supremacists decades after the civil war much of this debate like our politics in general since november focused on the feelings of white voters who feared their hi  was being taken from them so it was moving to hear white southern politician bluff broad shouldered guy who looks like football coach in an inspirational hollywood movie try to see the statues from the perspective of his city african american majority in the second decade of the st century landrieu said asking african americans or anyone else for that matter to drive by property that they own occupied by reverential statues of men who fought to destroy the country and deny that person humanity seems perverse it seems absurd he argued that city is entitled to choose whom it venerates unlike when these confederate monuments were erected as symbols of white supremacy we now have chance to create not only new symbols but to do it together as one people he said it may be sign of how starved we are for eloquent leadership that this speech led to talk of landrieu as potential presidential contender that chatter has only picked up with the publication of landrieu new book in the shadow of statues white southerner confronts hi  in politico donna brazile and james carville were recently quoted cheering him on carville described him as talent on the scale of bill clinton or barack obama when spoke to landrieu in new york recently he insisted he wasn laying the groundwork for campaign and didn see niche for himself in what will likely be crowded field of course that not quite denial have no idea if he have chance suspect he far too much of centrist for most democratic primary voters he certainly is for me still glad to see him celebrated because he done something in his speech and his book that other politicians should emulate he tried to reckon with america sins while offering an optimistic big hearted and deeply patriotic defense of cosmopolitanism as the source of american greatness american identity has always been contested but for several decades before donald trump became president there were areas of broad concord ideas so widely accepted they were either invisible or clich politicians from both parties called america nation of immigrants the latin phrase pluribus unum out of many one was treated as de facto national motto almost everyone in public life spoke of the emma lazarus poem mounted inside the pedestal of the statue of liberty give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free with reverence racist demagogy obviously existed in our politics but overt white nationalism was confined to the fringes drawing on darker older strains of american hi  trump has systematically attacked this post civil rights era consensus it one reason his presidency feels to many of us like such an existential assault in defending confederate statues trump has inveighed against removing historical symbols yet his administration is promiscuous in trashing the symbols of diversity indeed for all his buffoonish ignorance the power of symbols is something trump understands far better than most politicians under trump the united states citizenship and immigration services has removed language from its mission statement about securing america promise as nation of immigrants on the presidential coin which presidents hand out as mementos pluribus unum has been replaced by make america great again stephen miller an influential trump adviser dismissed lazarus poem as something that was added later and was not part of the original statue of liberty the changes in american life under trump of course aren just symbolic several metrics show increases in hate crimes brian levin director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at california state university san bernardino told me that there were more hate crimes in november than in any november since federal record keeping began in white supremacy has become both more open and more mainstream the fox news host tucker carlson does segments decrying demographic change and warning about an influx of unhygienic gypsies landrieu the mayor of city beloved for its hybrid polyglot culture is pushing back against this tide in his book he writes about serving in the state legislature alongside david duke the former grand wizard of the ku klux klan whom he sees as predecessor to trump he describes the way many louisiana republicans aware of duke popularity with their own voters failed to take him on leaving sinister spectacle in which truth was lost it taught him he writes about the need to confront bigotry and pull it up from the root there is no other way forward trying to move forward and honor the diverse hi  of his city has cost landrieu though people float his name for president his stance on the confederate monuments has probably made him unelectable to any statewide office one poll showed that percent of white louisianians opposed the monuments removal

france presse getty imagesby roger cohenmarch paris it is tempting to say that the relationship between president emmanuel macron of france and president trump is the unlikeliest of friendships but that   be to miss the point sure they agree on very little not on iran not on trade not on the european union not on climate not on whether to criticize vladimir putin not on the importance of dignity or truth or the enlightenment still hear that they speak all the time trump follows macron labor market reforms and calls to congratulate him the first state visit of his administration will be macron

anywhere with germany angela merkel trump macron is the only trans atlantic hinge not creaking this is not really surprising both men came from nowhere mavericks hoisted to the highest offices of their lands by wave of disgust at politics as usual they are in their way accidents of hi  thrust to power at the passing of an era longing for disruption produced these two disrupters both laid waste to the political establishment either smashing or co opting mainstream parties both understood the fact that voters were bored as well as angry mistrustful of the liberal consensus angry at globalization predations restive for grandeur thirsty for the outspoken rather than the dutiful warnings of experts macron who at   be trump son has honed grandiose theater of the center thereby giving centrist politics new vigor at time of extremist temptation he tough on immigration because he knows his survival depends on it trump is the theater of the zigzagging bully nonstop noise often drowning out meaning for both men movement and action are essential gaullist pomp shunned by macron predecessor is back if that what it takes to defeat the racist national front bring it on macron

to trumpet some billion in foreign investment it not make france great again except that it is sort of french friend observed macron bastille day celebration complete with guards on horseback troops tanks and fighter jets so impressed his   guest trump that trump now wants his own version with heavy air component but sans tanks on veterans day ridiculous think this friendship is so important as trump surrounds himself with hawks that prepared to swallow hard or rather it potentially so important we have yet to see what macron can leverage from this relationship we don know if it nice thing or beneficial thing it did not stop trump from leaving the climate accord or recognizing jerusalem as israel capital the jury is still out trump did exempt the european union from steel and aluminum tariffs an issue on which the french had pressed hard if we are viewed like china that   be big problem one senior official told me before trump decision next up iran if macron cannot avert the worst on iran decision by trump on may to torpedo the nuclear deal by no longer waiving sanctions then all bets are off the accord which reversed the program that had made iran threshold nuclear power is

nonproliferation treaty   fray to the point of meaninglessness the signs are not good mike pompeo nominated by trump as the next secretary of state is an iran hawk john bolton the new national security adviser who will replace lt gen mcmaster wants to abrogate the nuclear deal and bring down the iranian regime and that just for starters devastation looms macron and europe challenge in blocking iran folly has just grown tougher as trump behavior becomes more erratic trend the russia investigation will only accentuate in the coming months the macron friendship is some insurance against the worst unlike trump the french president knows what he wants and is capable of pursuing coherent strategy he also bulwark against all the destructiveness trump has embraced ethno nationalist bigotry the growing authoritarianism of putin and xi jinping the erosion of the rule of law trade wars the militarization of foreign policy and the undercutting of the european union

legislation that broadly repudiated an agenda that once foresaw the reshaping of the federal government into his america first image enactment of the bipartisan spending package which had seemed like certainty at dawn brought an end to hours of chaos at the white   where mr trump surprised his advisers and republican congressional leaders with an angry morning tweet threatening to sink measure

hiring of thousands of new border patrol agents stopped deep cuts to foreign aid the diplomatic corps and environmental programs thwarted push to fund vouchers for private and parochial schools and

dramatic denouement for the spending bill which drew fury from mr trump core supporters left both political parties in washington reeling and some of his own aides bewildered about the president contradictory actions yet it was only the latest instance of mr trump chafing against the advice of his advisers and throwing his own brand of chaos into the gears of the federal government mr trump grudging embrace only highlighted the degree to which president who portrays himself as the ultimate dealmaker has been sidelined by congressional leaders in both parties when it comes to striking compromises to fund the core functions of government instead mr trump has proved unable to find way to negotiate victories on some of his highest priorities ardent conservatives who are mr trump core backers were left wondering aloud whether the president capitulation and failures   imperil republicans chances of keeping control of congress in the midterm elections this fall amy kremer tea party activist who helped founded women for trump tweeted done democrats just won november midterms no point in wasting my time between now and then ms kremer wrote mr trump said the spending plan was

policy opt out or contact us anytime am considering veto of the omnibus spending bill based on the fact that the plus daca recipients have been totally abandoned by the democrats not even mentioned in bill and the border wall which is desperately needed for our national defense is not fully funded mr trump wrote he was referring partly to the fact that he failed to reach deal with democrats to include provisions in the spending measure that   preserve deferred action for childhood arrivals or daca an obama era program that mr trump rescinded last fall the program allows undocumented immigrants brought to the united states as children to apply for permits to work legally and avoid deportation but the president was most angry about the lack of funding in the bill for an enormous

mattis the secretary of defense to make the case to mr trump that he must sign the legislation because of its robust military funding within hours mr mattis was in the oval office with mr trump telling him the level of military spending was historic according to senior white   official vice president mike pence who had postponed trip to deal with the crisis also chimed in to make case for signing the bill the president relented in his remarks not long after mr trump expressed disappointment and said he was not happy that the bill did not allocate the full billion that the administration had requested for the wall but he sought to claim some measure of victory saying that billion does start the wall and promising to make that billion go very very far the political whiplash that he had put washington through was reflected in mr trump own comments at   he seemed to direct blame for the spending bill on republican lawmakers but later he praised them for doing their best in tough situation just want to thank members of congress for working so hard he said there are lot of strings pulling everyone in different directions the president threat came as surprise

california and the minority leader said in statement she added the omnibus also rejects the trump administration cruel anti immigrant agenda mr trump said on friday afternoon that it was democrats who had balked at including an extension of daca in the spending bill claiming that republicans wanted to protect immigrants from deportation but were blocked by democrats in fact over the weekend the white   offered to extend protections for hundreds of thousands of current daca recipients for two and half years with no guarantee beyond that time in exchange for billion for the border wall according to congressional aides democrats countered by saying they   agree to the full billion only if the president agreed to pathway to citizenship for much broader population of young immigrants

supported by business day the trump boom is making it harder to see the next recession economic view by robert shiller march     the main   share this page     the main     credit brian britigan when big shifts like recessions are on the way economists just aren very good at predicting them the truth is that we really can foresee where the economy will be heading in year or two limitation that is particularly troubling right now in the midst of what may be called the trump economic boom president trump is after all public figure like no other and his unique and polarizing effect on mass psychology   to be muddling the economic data even more than usual consider how easy it is to be lulled into complacency about the current state of the economy growth in the gross domestic product has been strong the tax cuts and jobs act amounts to stimulative fiscal policy interest rates are still low and consumer confidence is high advertisement     the main   all of this may cause us to assume that the economy will expand forever and lead us to forget that recessions tend to come on average every five years though lately some have taken longer than that to develop since according to the national bureau of economic research the united states has had recessions and it has already been months since the last one     the main   advertisement     the main   if the economy manages to expand for more months the united states will have set record but whenever recession arrives the timing is likely to surprise most economists data from to supplied by the federal reserve bank of philadelphia in its quarterly survey of professional forecasters shows that while professional forecasters as group have had some ability to assess the probability that will decline in the next three months they have exhibited no ability to do so year in the future in fact the latest survey gives percent probability that real will decline year from now which is the average probability for decline in one year given in all of the surveys since in essence these forecasters are saying that nothing   is on the horizon the risk of recession is perfectly average that might be comforting if these predictions were accurate but sadly they are not then there are the confidence indexes which measure perceptions of business activity in the present and near future there are strong  s in much of the world but these findings are limited in their scope the conference board for example in its compilation of the consumer confidence index in the united states essentially asks respondents whether they think we are on the verge of recession or may even be in one the index does not plumb the underlying attitudes that might be setting the stage either for long and strong boom or long and damaging depression though it is leading indicator of short term shifts at the moment mr trump   to be elevating the levels of the main confidence indexes that to be expected he may well be the first president who is at his core

warming is real and human generated who   dare to take on all those scientists mr trump   because their conclusions just don sound right to him even if he can explain why and the trump narrative presents him as an unrivaled success billionaire bon vivant and now president in the same book mr trump said his approach implied stress want to tell you about the negatives of business as well as the positives want to talk about the fact that most people are not cut out to deal with the high stress level of being great success but he advocates stressful risk taking not quiet contemplation for readers who can handle it advertisement     the main   mr trump has personified these ideas and attracted millions of people to them shifting mass psychology in ways that the confidence indexes will have hard time capturing the indexes routinely miss the major changes in spirit that cause long term economic phenomena like the reckless prosperity of the roaring twenties decade of high adventuresome spirit in business too high actually this confidence crashed shifting into the gloom of the great depression of the period characterized by waves of recriminations and disappointment as the decade wore on the term secular stagnation became prominent that depression was great partly because it lasted more than years it wasn the kind of greatness that mr trump aspires to in his slogan make america great again future downturn isn widespread top of mind concern the confidence indexes show instead we may surmise that at the moment many people are emulating mr trump and trying to think big even those who loathe him might be inspired by his personal success though this isn being measured by the confidence indexes but at some point significant recession will appear we can only guess what might make it materialize contagious words and stories analogous to those using the metoo hashtag   be enough to change the public mood about the trump boom maybe shift will come from the kind of stories that contributed to the dot com collapse tales of recently revered companies that turned out to have taken too many chances and so flamed out and crashed downturn   be set off by compromising stories about mr trump himself possibly those impugning his judgment in starting an international trade war or maybe it will be something subtler whose link to animal spirits and mass psychology is

advertisementopinionsupported bythe white southern anti trumpimagemayor mitch landrieu of new orleans speech he gave after the city pulled down four confederate statues led to talk of mr landrieu as potential presidential contender creditjacquelyn martin associated pressby michelle goldbergmarch last may mitch landrieu the mayor of new orleans delivered one of the most stirring and important speeches of the trump era without once deigning to mention the president name he spoke after new orleans pulled down four confederate monuments the culmination of ferocious two year political fight that included threats armed right wing protesters and car being firebombed all around the country there was bitter debate about what to do with monuments to slavery and treason most erected by white supremacists decades after the civil war much of this debate like our politics in general since november focused on the feelings of white voters who feared their hi  was being taken from them so it was moving to hear white southern politician bluff broad shouldered guy who looks like football coach in an inspirational hollywood movie try to see the statues from the perspective of his city african american majority in the second decade of the st century landrieu said asking african americans or anyone else for that matter to drive by property that they own occupied by reverential statues of men who fought to destroy the country and deny that person humanity seems perverse it seems absurd he argued that city is entitled to choose whom it venerates unlike when these confederate monuments were erected as symbols of white supremacy we now have chance to create not only new symbols but to do it together as one people he said it may be sign of how starved we are for eloquent leadership that this speech led to talk of landrieu as potential presidential contender that chatter has only picked up with the publication of landrieu new book in the shadow of statues white southerner confronts hi  in politico donna brazile and james carville were recently quoted cheering him on carville described him as talent on the scale of bill clinton or barack obama when spoke to landrieu in new york recently he insisted he wasn laying the groundwork for campaign and didn see niche for himself in what will likely be crowded field of course that not quite denial have no idea if he have chance suspect he far too much of centrist for most democratic primary voters he certainly is for me still glad to see him celebrated because he done something in his speech and his book that other politicians should emulate he tried to reckon with america sins while offering an optimistic big hearted and deeply patriotic defense of cosmopolitanism as the source of american greatness american identity has always been contested but for several decades before donald trump became president there were areas of broad concord ideas so widely accepted they were either invisible or clich politicians from both parties called america nation of immigrants the latin phrase pluribus unum out of many one was treated as de facto national motto almost everyone in public life spoke of the emma lazarus poem mounted inside the pedestal of the statue of liberty give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free with reverence racist demagogy obviously existed in our politics but overt white nationalism was confined to the fringes drawing on darker older strains of american hi  trump has systematically attacked this post civil rights era consensus it one reason his presidency feels to many of us like such an existential assault in defending confederate statues trump has inveighed against removing historical symbols yet his administration is promiscuous in trashing the symbols of diversity indeed for all his buffoonish ignorance the power of symbols is something trump understands far better than most politicians under trump the united states citizenship and immigration services has removed language from its mission statement about securing america promise as nation of immigrants on the presidential coin which presidents hand out as mementos pluribus unum has been replaced by make america great again stephen miller an influential trump adviser dismissed lazarus poem as something that was added later and was not part of the original statue of liberty the changes in american life under trump of course aren just symbolic several metrics show increases in hate crimes brian levin director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at california state university san bernardino told me that there were more hate crimes in november than in any november since federal record keeping began in white supremacy has become both more open and more mainstream the fox news host tucker carlson does segments decrying demographic change and warning about an influx of unhygienic gypsies landrieu the mayor of city beloved for its hybrid polyglot culture is pushing back against this tide in his book he writes about serving in the state legislature alongside david duke the former grand wizard of the ku klux klan whom he sees as predecessor to trump he describes the way many louisiana republicans aware of duke popularity with their own voters failed to take him on leaving sinister spectacle in which truth was lost it taught him he writes about the need to confront bigotry and pull it up from the root there is no other way forward trying to move forward and honor the diverse hi  of his city has cost landrieu though people float his name for president his stance on the confederate monuments has probably made him unelectable to any statewide office one poll showed that percent of white louisianians opposed the monuments removal

that   be to miss the point sure they agree on very little not on iran not on trade not on the european union not on climate not on whether to criticize vladimir putin not on the importance of dignity or truth or the enlightenment still hear that they speak all the time trump follows macron labor market reforms and calls to congratulate him the first state visit of his administration will be macron to washington next month   honor for great guy the french president is trump best friend in europe and possibly beyond things fizzled with theresa may the british prime minister they never went anywhere with germany angela merkel trump macron is the only trans atlantic hinge not creaking this is not really surprising both men came from nowhere mavericks hoisted to the highest offices of their lands by wave of disgust at politics as usual they are in their way accidents of hi  thrust to power at the passing of an era longing for disruption produced these two disrupters both laid waste to the political establishment either smashing or co opting mainstream parties both understood the fact that voters were bored as well as angry mistrustful of the liberal consensus angry at globalization predations restive for grandeur thirsty for the outspoken rather than the dutiful warnings of experts macron who at   be trump son has honed grandiose theater of the center thereby giving centrist politics new vigor at time of extremist temptation he tough on immigration because he knows his survival depends on it trump is the theater of the zigzagging bully nonstop noise often drowning out meaning for both men movement and action are essential gaullist pomp shunned by macron predecessor is back if that what it takes to defeat the racist national front bring it on macron celebrated his victory last year with an address to the french people at the louvre greeted putin at versailles and returned to the sun king palace this year for choose france summit meeting of global to trumpet some billion in foreign investment it not make france great again except that it is sort of french friend observed macron bastille day celebration complete with guards on horseback troops tanks and fighter jets so impressed his   guest trump that trump now wants his own version with heavy air component but sans tanks on veterans day ridiculous think this friendship is so important as trump surrounds himself with hawks that prepared to swallow hard or rather it potentially so important we have yet to see what macron can leverage from this relationship we don know if it nice thing or beneficial thing it did not stop trump from leaving the climate accord or recognizing jerusalem as israel capital the jury is still out trump did exempt the european union from steel and aluminum tariffs an issue on which the french had pressed hard if we are viewed like china that   be big problem one senior official told me before trump decision next up iran if macron cannot avert the worst on iran decision by trump on may to torpedo the nuclear deal by no longer waiving sanctions then all bets are off the accord which reversed the program that had made iran threshold nuclear power is working the french are determined to preserve it if it collapses the shia sunni middle eastern confrontation will worsen iran may race for bomb and saudi arabia will not be far behind the nuclear

security adviser who will replace lt gen mcmaster wants to abrogate the nuclear deal and bring down the iranian regime and that just for starters devastation looms macron and europe challenge in blocking iran folly has just grown tougher as trump behavior becomes more erratic trend the russia investigation will only accentuate in the coming months the macron friendship is some insurance against the worst unlike trump the french president knows what he wants and is capable of pursuing coherent strategy he also bulwark against all the destructiveness trump has embraced ethno nationalist bigotry the growing authoritarianism of putin and xi jinping the erosion of the rule of law trade wars the militarization of foreign policy and the undercutting of the european union

immigrants brought to the united states as children to apply for permits to work legally and avoid deportation but the president was most angry about the lack of funding in the bill for an enormous wall across the nation southern border that he has billed as the centerpiece of his crackdown on illegal immigration the measure includes nearly billion for border security including new technology and repairs to existing barriers but not mr trump wall as he claimed on twitter on wednesday advertisement     the main   it provides million for about miles of new fencing but prohibits building concrete structure or other prototypes the president has considered mr trump morning tweet set off scramble on capitol hill and at the white   speaker paul ryan republican of wisconsin phoned mr trump and encouraged him to sign the measure according to source familiar with the call citing all the wins contained in the bill e ly for the military the president top advisers rushed to bring in jim mattis the secretary of defense to make the case to mr trump that he must sign the legislation because of its robust military funding within hours mr mattis was in the oval office with mr trump telling him the level of military spending was historic according to senior white   official vice president mike pence who had postponed trip to deal with the crisis also chimed in to make case for signing the bill the president relented in his remarks not long after mr trump expressed disappointment and said he was not happy that the bill did not allocate the full billion that the administration had requested for the wall but he sought to claim some measure of victory saying that billion does start the wall and promising to make that billion go very very far the political whiplash that he had put washington through was reflected in mr trump own comments at   he seemed to direct blame for the spending bill on republican lawmakers but later he praised them for doing their best in tough situation just want to thank members of congress for working so hard he said there are lot of strings pulling everyone in different directions the president threat came as surprise but hardly shock to republican leaders who spent much of snowy wednesday privately imploring an agitated mr trump to put aside his objections and back the measure claiming it as win sensing political advantage democrats were unperturbed by mr trump veto threat fire drill top democratic aides said on friday morning that they   not make concessions to mr trump if he chose to reject the legislation but lawmakers stayed silent until the president signed the bill then they cheered the measure as disavowal of mr trump ideas advertisement     the main   in sharp contrast to the devastating cuts called for in the trump budget the omnibus contains robust funding to combat homelessness create new affordable housing and promote community development representative nancy pelosi democrat of california and the minority leader said in statement she added the omnibus also rejects the trump administration cruel anti immigrant agenda mr trump said on friday afternoon that it was democrats who had balked at including an extension of daca in the spending bill claiming that republicans wanted to protect immigrants from deportation but were blocked by democrats in fact over the weekend the white   offered to extend protections for hundreds of thousands of current daca recipients for two and half years with no guarantee beyond that time in exchange for billion for the border wall according to congressional aides democrats countered by saying they   agree to the full billion only if the president agreed to pathway to citizenship for much broader population of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children well over million people deal that was similar to an earlier offer from mr trump the white   rejected the democratic offer nicholas fandos contributed

supported by business day the trump boom is making it harder to see the next recession economic view by robert shiller march     the main   share this page     the main     credit brian britigan when big shifts like recessions are on the way economists just aren very good at predicting them the truth is that we really can foresee where the economy will be heading in year or two limitation that is particularly troubling right now in the midst of what may be called the trump economic boom president trump is after all public figure like no other and his unique and polarizing effect on mass psychology   to be muddling the economic data even more than usual consider how easy it is to be lulled into complacency about the current state of the economy growth in the gross domestic product has been strong the tax cuts and jobs act amounts to stimulative fiscal policy interest rates are still low and consumer confidence is high advertisement     the main   all of this may cause us to assume that the economy will expand forever and lead us to forget that recessions tend to come on average every five years though lately some have taken longer than that to develop since according to the national bureau of economic research the united states has had recessions and it has already been months since the last one     the main   advertisement     the main   if the economy manages to expand for more months the united states will have set record but whenever recession arrives the timing is likely to surprise most economists data from to supplied by the federal reserve bank of philadelphia in its quarterly survey of professional forecasters shows that while professional forecasters as group have had some ability to assess the probability that will decline in the next three months they have exhibited no ability to do so year in the future in fact the latest survey gives percent probability that real will decline year from now which is the average probability for decline in one year given in all of the surveys since in essence these forecasters are saying that nothing   is on the horizon the risk of recession is perfectly average that might be comforting if these predictions were accurate but sadly they are not then there are the confidence indexes which measure perceptions of business activity in the present and near future there are strong  s in much of the world but these findings are limited in their scope the conference board for example in its compilation of the consumer confidence index in the united states essentially asks respondents whether they think we are on the verge of recession or may even be in one the index does not plumb the underlying attitudes that might be setting the stage either for long and strong boom or long and damaging depression though it is leading indicator of short term shifts at the moment mr trump   to be elevating the levels of the main confidence indexes that to be expected he may well be the first president who is at his core

warming is real and human generated who   dare to take on all those scientists mr trump   because their conclusions just don sound right to him even if he can explain why and the trump narrative presents him as an unrivaled success billionaire bon vivant and now president in the same book mr trump said his approach implied stress want to tell you about the negatives of business as well as the positives want to talk about the fact that most people are not cut out to deal with the high stress level of being great success but he advocates stressful risk taking not quiet contemplation for readers who can handle it advertisement     the main   mr trump has personified these ideas and attracted millions of people to them shifting mass psychology in ways that the confidence indexes will have hard time capturing the indexes routinely miss the major changes in spirit that cause long term economic phenomena like the reckless prosperity of the roaring twenties decade of high adventuresome spirit in business too high actually this confidence crashed shifting into the gloom of the great depression of the period characterized by waves of recriminations and disappointment as the decade wore on the term secular stagnation became prominent that depression was great partly because it lasted more than years it wasn the kind of greatness that mr trump aspires to in his slogan make america great again future downturn isn widespread top of mind concern the confidence indexes show instead we may surmise that at the moment many people are emulating mr trump and trying to think big even those who loathe him might be inspired by his personal success though this isn being measured by the confidence indexes but at some point significant recession will appear we can only guess what might make it materialize contagious words and stories analogous to those using the metoo hashtag   be enough to change the public mood about the trump boom maybe shift will come from the kind of stories that contributed to the dot com collapse tales of recently revered companies that turned out to have taken too many chances and so flamed out and crashed downturn   be set off by compromising stories about mr trump himself possibly those impugning his judgment in starting an international trade war or maybe it will be something subtler whose link to animal spirits and mass psychology is

potential presidential contender creditjacquelyn martin associated pressby michelle goldbergmarch last may mitch landrieu the mayor of new orleans delivered one of the most stirring and important speeches of the trump era without once deigning to mention the president name he spoke after new orleans pulled down four confederate monuments the culmination of ferocious two year political fight that included threats armed right wing protesters and car being firebombed all around the country there was bitter debate about what to do with monuments to slavery and treason most erected by white supremacists decades after the civil war much of this debate like our politics in general since november focused on the feelings of white voters who feared their hi  was being taken from them so it was moving to hear white southern politician bluff broad shouldered guy who looks like football coach in an inspirational hollywood movie try to see the statues from the perspective of his city african american majority in the second decade of the st century landrieu said asking african americans or anyone else for that matter to drive by property that they own occupied by reverential statues of men who fought to destroy the country and deny that person humanity seems perverse it seems absurd he argued that city is entitled to choose whom it venerates unlike when these confederate monuments were erected as symbols of white supremacy we now have chance to create not only new symbols but to do it together as one people he said it may be sign of how starved we are for eloquent leadership that this speech led to talk of landrieu as potential presidential contender that chatter has only picked up with the publication of landrieu new book in the shadow of statues white southerner confronts hi  in politico donna brazile and james carville were recently quoted cheering him on carville described him as talent on the scale of bill clinton or barack obama when spoke to landrieu in new york recently he insisted he wasn laying the groundwork for campaign and didn see niche for himself in what will likely be crowded field of course that not quite denial have no idea if he have chance suspect he far too much of centrist for most democratic primary voters he certainly is for me still glad to see him celebrated because he done something in his speech and his book that other politicians should emulate he tried to reckon with america sins while offering an optimistic big hearted and deeply patriotic defense of cosmopolitanism as the source of american greatness american identity has always been contested but for several decades before donald trump became president there were areas of broad concord ideas so widely accepted they were either invisible or clich politicians from both parties called america nation of immigrants the latin phrase pluribus unum out of many one was treated as de facto national motto almost everyone in public life spoke of the emma lazarus poem mounted inside the pedestal of the statue of liberty give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free with reverence racist demagogy obviously existed in our politics but overt white nationalism was confined to the fringes drawing on darker older strains of american hi  trump has systematically attacked this post civil rights era consensus it one reason his presidency feels to many of us like such an existential assault in defending confederate statues trump has inveighed against removing historical symbols yet his administration is promiscuous in trashing the symbols of diversity indeed for all his buffoonish ignorance the power of symbols is something trump understands far better than most politicians under trump the united states citizenship and immigration services has removed language from its mission statement about securing america promise as nation of immigrants on the presidential coin which presidents hand out as mementos pluribus unum has been replaced by make america great again stephen miller an influential trump adviser dismissed lazarus poem as something that was added later and was not part of the original statue of liberty the changes in american life under trump of course aren just symbolic several metrics show increases in hate crimes brian levin director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at california state university san bernardino told me that there were more hate crimes in november than in any november since federal record keeping began in white supremacy has become both more open and more mainstream the fox news host tucker carlson does segments decrying demographic change and warning about an influx of unhygienic gypsies landrieu the mayor of city beloved for its hybrid polyglot culture is pushing back against this tide in his book he writes about serving in the state legislature alongside david duke the former grand wizard of the ku klux klan whom he sees as predecessor to trump he describes the way many louisiana republicans aware of duke popularity with their own voters failed to take him on leaving sinister spectacle in which truth was lost it taught him he writes about the need to confront bigotry and pull it up from the root there is no other way forward trying to move forward and honor the diverse hi  of his city has cost landrieu though people float his name for president his stance on the confederate monuments has probably made him unelectable to any statewide office one poll showed that percent of white louisianians opposed the monuments removal

to the political establishment either smashing or co opting mainstream parties both understood the fact that voters were bored as well as angry mistrustful of the liberal consensus angry at

friday yielding to advisers and republican leaders who urged him against manufacturing government shutdown crisis even as he signed the bill the president seethed about being forced to swallow legislation that broadly repudiated an agenda that once foresaw the reshaping of the federal government into his america first image enactment of the bipartisan spending package which had seemed like certainty at dawn brought an end to hours of chaos at the white   where mr trump surprised his advisers and republican congressional leaders with an angry morning tweet threatening to sink measure that his aides had already promised he   sign his stated reason was its lack of funding for his promised border wall but that was only one disappointment for the president in measure that blocked the hiring of thousands of new border patrol agents stopped deep cuts to foreign aid the diplomatic corps and environmental programs thwarted push to fund vouchers for private and parochial schools and even rescued the national endowments for the arts and the humanities advertisement     the main   there are lot of things that unhappy about in this bill mr trump said during hastily called event at

if we want to build our military we were forced to have there are some things that we should have in the bill     the main   advertisement     the main   in rambling and disjointed statement from the diplomatic reception room mr trump called the process that yielded the legislation this ridiculous situation and he warned will never sign another bill like this again not going to do it again the dramatic denouement for the spending bill which drew fury from mr trump core supporters left both political parties in washington reeling and some of his own aides bewildered about the president contradictory actions yet it was only the latest instance of mr trump chafing against the advice of his advisers and throwing his own brand of chaos into the gears of the federal government mr trump grudging embrace only highlighted the degree to which president who portrays himself as the ultimate dealmaker has been sidelined by congressional leaders in both parties when it comes to striking compromises to fund the core functions of government instead mr trump has proved unable to find way to negotiate victories on some of his highest priorities ardent conservatives who are mr trump core backers were left wondering aloud whether the president capitulation and failures   imperil republicans chances of keeping control of congress in the midterm elections this fall amy kremer tea party activist who helped founded women for trump tweeted done democrats just won november midterms no point in wasting my time between now and then ms kremer wrote mr trump said the spending plan was important because it includes hundreds of billions of dollars in military spending to ensure that the united states has by far the strongest military in the world we had no choice but to fund our military mr trump declared   aloud series of military programs and weapons systems in the spending bill including submarines missile defense systems tanks helicopters and warships advertisement     the main   but in bizarre version of the usually upbeat bill signing ceremonies at the white   mr trump then went on to denigrate the legislation as crazy nobody read it mr trump said of the gargantuan funding measure drawn up by republican and democratic leaders in the   and the senate echoing criticism from those who voted against it mr trump added it only hours old he urged lawmakers to avoid passage of another so called omnibus bill and to instead pass legislation giving him line item veto of spending measures something that the supreme court has already ruled to be unconstitutional he also called on the senate to eliminate filibusters looked very seriously at the veto mr trump told reporters was thinking about doing the veto if he had it   almost certainly have shut down the government at midnight just as hundreds of thousands of teenagers and adults were scheduled to descend on washington for gun control march on saturday with congress on spring recess for two weeks starting monday many lawmakers had already departed washington and some were on their way out of the country as part of official congressional delegations the spending measure cleared

policy opt out or contact us anytime am considering veto of the omnibus spending bill based on the fact that the plus daca recipients have been totally abandoned by the democrats not even mentioned in bill and the border wall which is desperately needed for our national defense is not fully funded mr trump wrote he was referring partly to the fact that he failed to reach deal with democrats to include provisions in the spending measure that   preserve deferred action for childhood arrivals or daca an obama era program that mr trump rescinded last fall the program allows undocumented immigrants brought to the united states as children to apply for permits to work legally and avoid deportation but the president was most angry about the lack of funding in the bill for an enormous wall across the nation southern border that he has billed as the centerpiece of his crackdown on illegal immigration the measure includes nearly billion for border security including new technology and repairs to existing barriers but not mr trump wall as he claimed on twitter on wednesday advertisement     the main   it provides million for about miles of new fencing but prohibits building concrete structure or other prototypes the president has considered mr trump morning tweet set off scramble on capitol hill and at the white   speaker paul ryan republican of wisconsin phoned mr trump and encouraged him to sign the measure according to source familiar with the call citing all the wins contained in the bill e ly for the military the president top advisers rushed to bring in jim mattis the secretary of defense to make the case to mr trump that he must sign the legislation because of its robust military funding within hours mr mattis was in the oval office with mr trump telling him the level of military spending was historic according to senior white   official vice president mike pence who had postponed trip to deal with the crisis also chimed in to make case for signing the bill the president relented in his remarks not long after mr trump expressed disappointment and said he was not happy that the bill did not allocate the full billion that the administration had requested for the wall but he sought to claim some measure of victory saying that billion does start the wall and promising to make that billion go very very far the political whiplash that he had put washington through was reflected in mr trump own comments at   he seemed to direct blame for the spending bill on republican lawmakers but later he praised them for doing their best in tough situation just want to thank members of congress for working so hard he said there are lot of strings pulling everyone in different directions the president threat came as surprise but hardly shock to republican leaders who spent much of snowy wednesday privately imploring an agitated mr trump to put aside his objections and back the measure claiming it as win sensing political advantage democrats were unperturbed by mr trump veto threat fire drill top democratic aides said on friday morning that they   not make concessions to mr trump if he chose to reject the legislation but lawmakers stayed silent until the president signed the bill then they cheered the measure as disavowal of mr trump ideas advertisement     the main   in sharp contrast to the devastating cuts called for in the trump budget the omnibus contains robust funding to combat homelessness create new affordable housing and promote community development representative nancy pelosi democrat of california and the minority leader said in statement she added the omnibus also rejects the trump administration cruel anti immigrant agenda mr trump said on friday afternoon that it was democrats who had balked at including an extension of daca in the spending bill claiming that republicans wanted to protect immigrants from deportation but were blocked by democrats in fact over the weekend the white   offered to extend protections for hundreds of thousands of current daca recipients for two and half years with no guarantee beyond that time in exchange for billion for the border wall according to congressional aides democrats countered by saying they   agree to the full billion only if the president agreed to pathway to citizenship for much broader population of young immigrants

supported by business day the trump boom is making it harder to see the next recession economic view by robert shiller march     the main   share this page     the main     credit brian britigan when big shifts like recessions are on the way economists just aren very good at predicting them the truth is that we really can foresee where the economy will be heading in year or two limitation that is particularly troubling right now in the midst of what may be called the trump economic boom president trump is after all public figure like no other and his unique and polarizing effect on mass psychology   to be muddling the economic data even more than usual consider how easy it is to be lulled into complacency about the current state of the economy growth in the gross domestic product has been strong the tax cuts and jobs act amounts to stimulative fiscal policy interest rates are still low and consumer confidence is high advertisement     the main   all of this may cause us to assume that the economy will expand forever and lead us to forget that recessions tend to come on average every five years though lately some have taken longer than that to develop since according to the national bureau of economic research the united states has had recessions and it has already been months since the last one     the main   advertisement     the main   if the economy manages to expand for more months the united states will have set record but whenever recession arrives the timing is likely to surprise most economists data from to supplied by the federal reserve bank of philadelphia in its quarterly survey of professional forecasters shows that while professional forecasters as group have had some ability to assess the probability that will decline in the next three months they have exhibited no ability to do so year in the future in fact the latest survey gives percent probability that real will decline year from now which is the average probability for decline in one year given in all of the surveys since in essence these forecasters are saying that nothing   is on the horizon the risk of recession is perfectly average that might be comforting if these predictions were accurate but sadly they are not then there are the confidence indexes which measure perceptions of business activity in the present and near future there are strong  s in much of the world but these findings are limited in their scope the conference board for example in its compilation of the consumer confidence index in the united states essentially asks respondents whether they think we are on the verge of recession or may even be in one the index does not plumb the underlying attitudes that might be setting the stage either for long and strong boom or long and damaging depression though it is leading indicator of short term shifts at the moment mr trump   to be elevating the levels of the main confidence indexes that to be expected he may well be the first president who is at his core

warming is real and human generated who   dare to take on all those scientists mr trump   because their conclusions just don sound right to him even if he can explain why and the trump narrative presents him as an unrivaled success billionaire bon vivant and now president in the same book mr trump said his approach implied stress want to tell you about the negatives of business as well as the positives want to talk about the fact that most people are not cut out to deal with the high stress level of being great success but he advocates stressful risk taking not quiet contemplation for readers who can handle it advertisement     the main   mr trump has personified these ideas and attracted millions of people to them shifting mass psychology in ways that the confidence indexes will have hard time capturing the indexes routinely miss the major changes in spirit that cause long term economic phenomena like the reckless prosperity of the roaring twenties decade of high adventuresome spirit in business too high actually this confidence crashed shifting into the gloom of the great depression of the period characterized by waves of recriminations and disappointment as the decade wore on the term secular stagnation became prominent that depression was great partly because it lasted more than years it wasn the kind of greatness that mr trump aspires to in his slogan make america great again future downturn isn widespread top of mind concern the confidence indexes show instead we may surmise that at the moment many people are emulating mr trump and trying to think big even those who loathe him might be inspired by his personal success though this isn being measured by the confidence indexes but at some point significant recession will appear we can only guess what might make it materialize contagious words and stories analogous to those using the metoo hashtag   be enough to change the public mood about the trump boom maybe shift will come from the kind of stories that contributed to the dot com collapse tales of recently revered companies that turned out to have taken too many chances and so flamed out and crashed downturn   be set off by compromising stories about mr trump himself possibly those impugning his judgment in starting an international trade war or maybe it will be something subtler whose link to animal spirits and mass psychology is

potential presidential contender creditjacquelyn martin associated pressby michelle goldbergmarch last may mitch landrieu the mayor of new orleans delivered one of the most stirring and important speeches of the trump era without once deigning to mention the president name he spoke after new orleans pulled down four confederate monuments the culmination of ferocious two year political fight that included threats armed right wing protesters and car being firebombed all around the country there was bitter debate about what to do with monuments to slavery and treason most erected by white supremacists decades after the civil war much of this debate like our politics in general since november focused on the feelings of white voters who feared their hi  was being taken from them so it was moving to hear white southern politician bluff broad shouldered guy who looks like football coach in an inspirational hollywood movie try to see the statues from the perspective of his city african american majority in the second decade of the st century landrieu said asking african americans or anyone else for that matter to drive by property that they own occupied by reverential statues of men who fought to destroy the country and deny that person humanity seems perverse it seems absurd he argued that city is entitled to choose whom it venerates unlike when these confederate monuments were erected as symbols of white supremacy we now have chance to create not only new symbols but to do it together as one people he said it may be sign of how starved we are for eloquent leadership that this speech led to talk of landrieu as potential presidential contender that chatter has only picked up with the publication of landrieu new book in the shadow of statues white southerner confronts hi  in politico donna brazile and james carville were recently quoted cheering him on carville described him as talent on the scale of bill clinton or barack obama when spoke to landrieu in new york recently he insisted he wasn laying the groundwork for campaign and didn see niche for himself in what will likely be crowded field of course that not quite denial have no idea if he have chance suspect he far too much of centrist for most democratic primary voters he certainly is for me still glad to see him celebrated because he done something in his speech and his book that other politicians should emulate he tried to reckon with america sins while offering an optimistic big hearted and deeply patriotic defense of cosmopolitanism as the source of american greatness

lazarus poem mounted inside the pedestal of the statue of liberty give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free with reverence racist demagogy obviously existed in our politics but overt white nationalism was confined to the fringes drawing on darker older strains of american hi  trump has systematically attacked this post civil rights era consensus it one reason his presidency feels to many of us like such an existential assault in defending confederate statues trump has inveighed against removing historical symbols yet his administration is promiscuous in trashing the symbols of diversity indeed for all his buffoonish ignorance the power of symbols is something trump understands far better than most politicians under trump the united states citizenship and immigration services has removed language from its mission statement about securing america promise as nation of immigrants on the presidential coin which presidents hand out as mementos pluribus unum has been replaced by make america great again stephen miller an influential trump adviser dismissed lazarus poem as something that was added later and was not part of the original statue of

certainty at dawn brought an end to hours of chaos at the white   where mr trump surprised his advisers and republican congressional leaders with an angry morning tweet threatening to sink measure

contradictory actions yet it was only the latest instance of mr trump chafing against the advice of his advisers and throwing his own brand of chaos into the gears of the federal government mr trump grudging embrace only highlighted the degree to which president who portrays himself as the ultimate dealmaker has been sidelined by congressional leaders in both parties when it comes to striking compromises to fund the core functions of government instead mr trump has proved unable to find way to negotiate victories on some of his highest priorities ardent conservatives who are mr trump core

include provisions in the spending measure that   preserve deferred action for childhood arrivals or daca an obama era program that mr trump rescinded last fall the program allows undocumented immigrants brought to the united states as children to apply for permits to work legally and avoid deportation but the president was most angry about the lack of funding in the bill for an enormous

administration had requested for the wall but he sought to claim some measure of victory saying that billion does start the wall and promising to make that billion go very very far the political

california and the minority leader said in statement she added the omnibus also rejects the trump administration cruel anti immigrant agenda mr trump said on friday afternoon that it was democrats who had balked at including an extension of daca in the spending bill claiming that republicans wanted to protect immigrants from deportation but were blocked by democrats in fact over the weekend the white   offered to extend protections for hundreds of thousands of current daca recipients for two and half years with no guarantee beyond that time in exchange for billion for the border wall

supported by business day the trump boom is making it harder to see the next recession economic view by robert shiller march     the main   share this page     the main     credit brian britigan when big shifts like recessions are on the way economists just aren very good at predicting them the truth is that we really can foresee where the economy will be heading in year or two limitation that is particularly troubling right now in the midst of what may be called the trump economic boom president trump is after all public figure like no other and his unique and polarizing effect on mass psychology   to be muddling the economic data even more than usual consider how easy it is to be lulled into complacency about the current state of the economy growth in the gross domestic product has been strong the tax cuts and jobs act amounts to stimulative fiscal policy interest rates are still low and consumer confidence is high advertisement     the main   all of this may cause us to assume that the economy will expand forever and lead us to forget that recessions tend to come on average every five years though lately some have taken longer than that to develop since according to the national bureau of economic research the united states has had recessions and it has already been months since the last one     the main   advertisement     the main   if the economy manages to expand for more months the united states will have set record but whenever recession arrives the timing is likely to surprise most economists data from to supplied by the federal reserve bank of philadelphia in its quarterly survey of professional forecasters shows that while professional forecasters as group have had some ability to assess the probability that will decline in the next three months they have exhibited no ability to do so year in the future in fact the latest survey gives percent probability that real will decline year from now which is the average probability for decline in one year given in all of the surveys since in essence these forecasters are saying that nothing   is on the horizon the risk of recession is perfectly average that might be comforting if these predictions were accurate but sadly they are not then there are the confidence indexes which measure perceptions of business activity in the present and near future there are strong  s in much of the world but these findings are limited in their scope the conference board for example in its compilation of the consumer confidence index in the united states essentially asks respondents whether they think we are on the verge of recession or may even be in one the index does not plumb the underlying attitudes that might be setting the stage either for long and strong boom or long and damaging depression though it

warming is real and human generated who   dare to take on all those scientists mr trump   because their conclusions just don sound right to him even if he can explain why and the trump narrative presents him as an unrivaled success billionaire bon vivant and now president in the same book mr trump said his approach implied stress want to tell you about the negatives of business as well as the positives want to talk about the fact that most people are not cut out to deal with the high stress level of being great success but he advocates stressful risk taking not quiet contemplation for readers who can handle it advertisement     the main   mr trump has personified these ideas and attracted millions of people to them shifting mass psychology in ways that the confidence indexes will have hard time capturing the indexes routinely miss the major changes in spirit that cause long term economic phenomena like the reckless prosperity of the roaring twenties decade of high adventuresome spirit in business too high actually this confidence crashed shifting into the gloom of the great depression of the period characterized by waves of recriminations and disappointment as the decade wore on the term secular stagnation became prominent that depression was great partly because it lasted more than years it wasn the kind of greatness that mr trump aspires to in his slogan make america great again future downturn isn widespread top of mind concern the confidence indexes show instead we may surmise that at the moment many people are emulating mr trump and trying to think

advertisementopinionsupported bythe white southern anti trumpimagemayor mitch landrieu of new orleans speech he gave after the city pulled down four confederate statues led to talk of mr landrieu as potential presidential contender creditjacquelyn martin associated pressby michelle goldbergmarch last may mitch landrieu the mayor of new orleans delivered one of the most stirring and important speeches of the trump era without once deigning to mention the president name he spoke after new orleans pulled down four confederate monuments the culmination of ferocious two year political fight that included threats armed right wing protesters and car being firebombed all around the country there was bitter debate about what to do with monuments to slavery and treason most erected by white supremacists decades after the civil war much of this debate like our politics in general since november focused on the feelings of white voters who feared their hi  was being taken from them so it was moving to hear white southern politician bluff broad shouldered guy who looks like football coach in an inspirational hollywood movie try to see the statues from the perspective of his city african american majority in the second decade of the st century landrieu said asking african americans or anyone else for that matter to drive by property that they own occupied by reverential statues of men who fought to destroy the country and deny that person humanity seems perverse it seems absurd he argued that city is entitled to choose whom it venerates unlike when these confederate monuments were erected as symbols of white supremacy we now have chance to create not only new symbols but to do it together as one people he said it may be sign of how starved we are for eloquent leadership that this speech led to talk of landrieu as potential presidential contender that chatter has only picked up with the publication of landrieu new book in the shadow of statues white southerner confronts hi  in politico donna brazile and james carville were recently quoted cheering him on carville described him as talent on the scale of bill clinton or barack obama when spoke to landrieu in new york recently he insisted he wasn laying the groundwork for campaign and didn see niche for himself in what will likely be crowded field of course that not quite denial have no idea if he have chance suspect he far too much of centrist for most democratic primary voters he certainly is for me still glad to see him celebrated because he done something in his speech and his book that other politicians should emulate he tried to reckon with america sins while offering an optimistic big hearted and deeply patriotic defense of cosmopolitanism as the source of american greatness american identity has always been contested but for several decades before donald trump became president there were areas of broad concord ideas so widely accepted they were either invisible or clich politicians from both parties called america nation of immigrants the latin phrase pluribus unum out of many one was treated as de facto national motto almost everyone in public life spoke of the emma lazarus poem mounted inside the pedestal of the statue of liberty give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free with reverence racist demagogy obviously existed in our politics but overt white nationalism was confined to the fringes drawing on darker older strains of american hi  trump has systematically attacked this post civil rights era consensus it one reason his presidency feels to many of us like such an existential assault in defending confederate statues trump has inveighed against removing historical symbols yet his administration is promiscuous in trashing the symbols of diversity indeed for all his buffoonish ignorance the power of symbols is something trump understands far better than most politicians under trump the united states citizenship and immigration services has removed language from its mission statement about securing america promise as nation of immigrants on the presidential coin which presidents hand out as mementos pluribus unum has been replaced by make america great again stephen miller an influential trump adviser dismissed lazarus poem as something that was added later and was not part of the original statue of liberty the changes in american life under trump of course aren just symbolic several metrics show increases in hate crimes brian levin director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at california state university san bernardino told me that there were more hate crimes in november than in any november since federal record keeping began in white supremacy has become both more open and more mainstream the fox news host tucker carlson does segments decrying demographic change and warning about an influx of unhygienic gypsies landrieu the mayor of city beloved for its hybrid polyglot culture is pushing back against this tide in his book he writes about serving in the state legislature alongside david duke the former grand wizard of the ku klux klan whom he sees as predecessor to trump he describes the way many louisiana republicans aware of duke popularity with their own voters failed to take him on leaving sinister spectacle in which truth was lost it taught him he writes about the need to confront bigotry and pull it up from the root there is no other way forward trying to move forward and honor the diverse hi  of his city has cost landrieu though people float his name for president his stance on the confederate monuments has probably made him unelectable to any statewide office one poll showed that percent of white louisianians opposed the monuments removal

that   be to miss the point sure they agree on very little not on iran not on trade not on the european union not on climate not on whether to criticize vladimir putin not on the importance of dignity or truth or the enlightenment still hear that they speak all the time trump follows macron labor market reforms and calls to congratulate him the first state visit of his administration will be macron

to the political establishment either smashing or co opting mainstream parties both understood the fact that voters were bored as well as angry mistrustful of the liberal consensus angry at globalization predations restive for grandeur thirsty for the outspoken rather than the dutiful warnings of experts macron who at   be trump son has honed grandiose theater of the center thereby

tanks and fighter jets so impressed his   guest trump that trump now wants his own version with heavy air component but sans tanks on veterans day ridiculous think this friendship is so important as trump surrounds himself with hawks that prepared to swallow hard or rather it potentially so important we have yet to see what macron can leverage from this relationship we don know if it nice thing

certainty at dawn brought an end to hours of chaos at the white   where mr trump surprised his advisers and republican congressional leaders with an angry morning tweet threatening to sink measure that his aides had already promised he   sign his stated reason was its lack of funding for his promised border wall but that was only one disappointment for the president in measure that blocked the hiring of thousands of new border patrol agents stopped deep cuts to foreign aid the diplomatic corps and environmental programs thwarted push to fund vouchers for private and parochial schools and even rescued the national endowments for the arts and the humanities advertisement     the main   there are lot of things that unhappy about in this bill mr trump said during hastily called event at the white   where the president placed his hand on foot high copy of the page bill he said he had just signed there are lot of things that we shouldn have had in this bill but we were in sense forced if we want to build our military we were forced to have there are some things that we should have in the bill     the main   advertisement     the main   in rambling and disjointed statement from the diplomatic reception room mr trump called the process that yielded the legislation this ridiculous situation and he warned will never sign another bill like this again not going to do it again the dramatic denouement for the spending bill which drew fury from mr trump core supporters left both political parties in washington reeling and some of his own aides bewildered about the president contradictory actions yet it was only the latest instance of mr trump chafing against the advice of his advisers and throwing his own brand of chaos into the gears of the federal government mr trump grudging embrace only highlighted the degree to which president who portrays himself as the ultimate dealmaker has been sidelined by congressional leaders in both parties when it comes to striking compromises to fund the core functions of government instead mr trump has proved unable to find way to negotiate victories on some of his highest priorities ardent conservatives who are mr trump core backers were left wondering aloud whether the president capitulation and failures   imperil republicans chances of keeping control of congress in the midterm elections this fall amy kremer tea party activist who helped founded women for trump tweeted done democrats just won november midterms no point in wasting my time between now and then ms kremer wrote mr trump said the spending plan was important because it includes hundreds of billions of dollars in military spending to ensure that the united states has by far the strongest military in the world we had no choice but to fund our military mr trump declared   aloud series of military programs and weapons systems in the spending bill including submarines missile defense systems tanks helicopters and warships advertisement     the main   but in bizarre version of the usually upbeat bill signing ceremonies at the white   mr trump then went on to denigrate the legislation as crazy nobody read it mr trump said of the gargantuan funding measure drawn up by republican and democratic leaders in the   and the senate echoing criticism from those who voted against it mr trump added it only hours old he urged lawmakers to avoid passage of another so called omnibus bill and to instead pass legislation giving him line item veto of spending measures something that the supreme court has already ruled to be unconstitutional he also called on the senate to eliminate filibusters looked very seriously at the veto mr trump told reporters was thinking about doing the veto if he had it   almost certainly have shut down the government at midnight just as hundreds of thousands of teenagers and adults were scheduled to descend on washington for gun control march on saturday with congress on spring recess for two weeks starting monday many lawmakers had already departed washington and some were on their way out of the country as part of official congressional delegations the spending measure cleared congress early friday morning and while mr trump had made plain he was unhappy with some aspects of it his senior advisers spent thursday telling reporters that he   sign it then early friday on

bill and the border wall which is desperately needed for our national defense is not fully funded mr trump wrote he was referring partly to the fact that he failed to reach deal with democrats to include provisions in the spending measure that   preserve deferred action for childhood arrivals or daca an obama era program that mr trump rescinded last fall the program allows undocumented immigrants brought to the united states as children to apply for permits to work legally and avoid deportation but the president was most angry about the lack of funding in the bill for an enormous wall across the nation southern border that he has billed as the centerpiece of his crackdown on illegal immigration the measure includes nearly billion for border security including new technology and repairs to existing barriers but not mr trump wall as he claimed on twitter on wednesday advertisement     the main   it provides million for about miles of new fencing but prohibits building concrete structure or other prototypes the president has considered mr trump morning tweet set off scramble on capitol hill and at the white   speaker paul ryan republican of wisconsin phoned mr trump and encouraged him to sign the measure according to source familiar with the call citing all the wins contained in the bill e ly for the military the president top advisers rushed to bring in jim mattis the secretary of defense to make the case to mr trump that he must sign the legislation because of its robust military funding within hours mr mattis was in the oval office with mr trump telling him the level of military spending was historic according to senior white   official vice president mike pence who had postponed trip to deal with the crisis also chimed in to make case for signing the bill the president relented in his remarks not long after mr trump expressed disappointment and said he was not happy that the bill did not allocate the full billion that the administration had requested for the wall but he sought to claim some measure of victory saying that billion does start the wall and promising to make that billion go very very far the political whiplash that he had put washington through was reflected in mr trump own comments at   he seemed to direct blame for the spending bill on republican lawmakers but later he praised them for doing their best in tough situation just want to thank members of congress for working so hard he said there are lot of strings pulling everyone in different directions the president threat came as surprise but hardly shock to republican leaders who spent much of snowy wednesday privately imploring an agitated mr trump to put aside his objections and back the measure claiming it as win sensing political advantage democrats were unperturbed by mr trump veto threat fire drill top democratic aides said on friday morning that they   not make concessions to mr trump if he chose to reject the legislation but lawmakers stayed silent until the president signed the bill then they cheered the measure as disavowal of mr trump ideas advertisement     the main   in sharp contrast to the devastating cuts called for in the trump budget the omnibus contains robust funding to combat homelessness create new affordable housing and promote community development representative nancy pelosi democrat of california and the minority leader said in statement she added the omnibus also rejects the trump administration cruel anti immigrant agenda mr trump said on friday afternoon that it was democrats who had balked at including an extension of daca in the spending bill claiming that republicans wanted to protect immigrants from deportation but were blocked by democrats in fact over the weekend the white   offered to extend protections for hundreds of thousands of current daca recipients for two and half years with no guarantee beyond that time in exchange for billion for the border wall according to congressional aides democrats countered by saying they   agree to the full billion only if the president agreed to pathway to citizenship for much broader population of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children well over million people deal that was similar to an earlier offer from mr trump the white   rejected the democratic offer nicholas fandos contributed

supported by business day the trump boom is making it harder to see the next recession economic view by robert shiller march     the main   share this page     the main     credit brian britigan when big shifts like recessions are on the way economists just aren very good at predicting them the truth is that we really can foresee where the economy will be heading in year or two limitation that is particularly troubling right now in the midst of what may be called the trump economic boom president trump is after all public figure like no other and his unique and polarizing effect on mass psychology   to be muddling the economic data even more than usual consider how easy it is to be lulled into complacency about the current state of the economy growth in the gross domestic product has been strong the tax cuts and jobs act amounts to stimulative fiscal policy interest rates are still low and consumer confidence is high advertisement     the main   all of this may cause us to assume that the economy will expand forever and lead us to forget that recessions tend to come on average every five years though lately some have taken longer than that to develop since according to the national bureau of economic research the united states has had recessions and it has already been months since the last one     the main   advertisement     the main   if the economy manages to expand for more months the united states will have set record but whenever recession arrives the timing is likely to surprise most economists data from to supplied by the federal reserve bank of philadelphia in its quarterly survey of professional forecasters shows that while professional forecasters as group have had some ability to assess the probability that will decline in the next three months they have exhibited no ability to do so year in the future in fact the latest survey gives percent probability that real will decline year from now which is the average probability for decline in one year given in all of the surveys since in essence these forecasters are saying that nothing   is on the horizon the risk of recession is perfectly average that might be comforting if these predictions were accurate but sadly they are not then there are the confidence indexes which measure perceptions of business activity in the present and near future there are strong  s in much of the world but these findings are limited in their scope the conference board for example in its compilation of the consumer confidence index in the united states essentially asks respondents whether they think we are on the verge of recession or may even be in one the index does not plumb the underlying attitudes that might be setting the stage either for long and strong boom or long and damaging depression though it is leading indicator of short term shifts at the moment mr trump   to be elevating the levels of the main confidence indexes that to be expected he may well be the first president who is at his core motivational speaker go with your gut he said in the book think big and kick ass in business and life which he wrote with bill zanker the title was later changed to think big make it happen in

preferences not you privacy policy opt out or contact us anytime mr trump seems to be living example of going with your gut consider his comments on climate change scientists generally think global warming is real and human generated who   dare to take on all those scientists mr trump   because their conclusions just don sound right to him even if he can explain why and the trump narrative presents him as an unrivaled success billionaire bon vivant and now president in the same book mr trump said his approach implied stress want to tell you about the negatives of business as well as the positives want to talk about the fact that most people are not cut out to deal with the high stress level of being great success but he advocates stressful risk taking not quiet contemplation for readers who can handle it advertisement     the main   mr trump has personified these ideas and attracted millions of people to them shifting mass psychology in ways that the confidence indexes will have hard time capturing the indexes routinely miss the major changes in spirit that cause long term economic phenomena like the reckless prosperity of the roaring twenties decade of high adventuresome spirit in business too high actually this confidence crashed shifting into the gloom of the great depression of the period characterized by waves of recriminations and disappointment as the decade wore on the term secular stagnation became prominent that depression was great partly because it lasted more than years it wasn the kind of greatness that mr trump aspires to in his slogan make america great again future downturn isn widespread top of mind concern the confidence indexes show instead we may surmise that at the moment many people are emulating mr trump and trying to think big even those who loathe him might be inspired by his personal success though this isn being measured by the confidence indexes but at some point significant recession will appear we can only guess what might make it materialize contagious words and stories analogous to those using the metoo hashtag   be enough to change the public mood about the trump boom maybe shift will come from the kind of stories that contributed to the dot com collapse tales of recently revered companies that turned out to have taken too many chances and so flamed out and crashed downturn   be set off by compromising stories about mr trump himself possibly those impugning his judgment in starting an international trade war or maybe it will be something subtler whose link to animal spirits and mass psychology is only indirect we don really know what will do it but rest assured the next recession will surely come robert shiller is sterling professor of economics at yale version of this article   in print on
